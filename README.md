# L4_I2C

An I2C 'library' I made from scratch for fun.

Feel free to use it, but please note that the provided code shouldn't be used for actual I2C implementation. 

However, if you wanted a way to 'bit-bang' I2C signals, this could work for you. 

I simply made this to: 
 1. Understand I2C implementation on a somewhat low level.
 2. Have a tool for directly sending I2C signals with methods I can understand
